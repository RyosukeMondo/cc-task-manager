## Parallel Development Matrix

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
Can start immediately in parallel:

| Spec | Worker Type | Parallel Tasks | Outputs |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| **database-schema-completion** | Database Engineer | Schema design, migrations | Prisma schema, types |
| **bullmq-integration** | Infrastructure Engineer | Queue setup, Redis config | Job definitions, processors |
| **task-crud-api** | Backend Developer | API contracts, validation schemas | Zod schemas, OpenAPI spec |

**Key Success Criteria:**
- Database schema defines all entities and relationships
- BullMQ queues configured with basic job processing
- API contracts established with type-safe validation

### **Phase 2: Core Implementation (Week 2)**
Building on Phase 1 outputs:

| Spec | Worker Type | Dependencies | Focus |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| **task-crud-api** | Backend Developer | Database schema complete | Endpoint implementation |
| **claude-code-wrapper-integration** | Python Developer | BullMQ integration ready | STDIO interface implementation |
| **dashboard-frontend** | Frontend Developer | API contracts defined | UI components, state management |

**Key Success Criteria:**
- CRUD endpoints functional with full validation
- Claude Code wrapper executing tasks via BullMQ
- Dashboard displaying basic task information

### **Phase 3: Real-time Features (Week 3)**
Integrating live functionality:

| Spec | Worker Type | Dependencies | Focus |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| **realtime-websocket-events** | WebSocket Developer | API + Frontend ready | Event streaming, live updates |
| **dashboard-frontend** | Frontend Developer | WebSocket events available | Real-time UI updates |
| **claude-code-wrapper-integration** | Python Developer | Core wrapper working | Live progress streaming |

**Key Success Criteria:**
- Real-time task status updates working
- Live log streaming from Claude Code processes
- Dashboard shows live progress indicators

## Worker Specialization Areas

### **Database Engineer** (database-schema-completion)

- **Integration Points**: Provides foundation for all other components

### **Backend API Developer** (task-crud-api)
- **Skills**: NestJS, TypeScript, Zod validation, OpenAPI
- **Deliverables**: REST endpoints, validation schemas, API documentation
- **Integration Points**: Consumes database schema, provides API contracts

### **Queue Infrastructure Engineer** (bullmq-integration)
- **Skills**: BullMQ, Redis, job processing, monitoring
- **Deliverables**: Queue definitions, processors, monitoring dashboard
- **Integration Points**: Consumes database schema, provides job execution

### **Python Integration Specialist** (claude-code-wrapper-integration)
- **Skills**: Python, subprocess management, STDIO protocols
- **Deliverables**: Claude Code wrapper, process monitoring, error handling
- **Integration Points**: Integrates with BullMQ jobs, outputs to database

### **Frontend React Developer** (dashboard-frontend)
- **Skills**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query
- **Deliverables**: Dashboard components, state management, responsive UI
- **Integration Points**: Consumes API contracts, receives WebSocket events

### **WebSocket Real-time Developer** (realtime-websocket-events)
- **Skills**: Socket.IO, NestJS Gateway, event-driven architecture
- **Deliverables**: WebSocket gateway, event handlers, real-time protocols
- **Integration Points**: Bridges backend events to frontend updates

## Independent Development Strategies

### **Interface-First Development**
- Define TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas before implementation
- Generate OpenAPI specifications from schemas
- Use interface mocking for parallel frontend/backend development

### **Contract-Driven Integration**
- Establish API contracts and event schemas early
- Use TypeScript shared packages for type consistency
- Implement contract testing to verify integration points

### **Incremental Integration**
- Each spec produces working components that can be integrated individually
- Use feature flags to enable/disable incomplete features
- Continuous integration ensures compatibility as features merge

## Dependency Management

### **Minimal Dependencies**
- Most specs can begin with interface design immediately
- Only core implementation requires completed dependencies
- Database schema is the only blocking foundational requirement

### **Parallel API Development**
- Frontend can use mock data while backend implements endpoints
- WebSocket events can be designed while API endpoints are built
- Claude Code integration can use dummy jobs while queue system is built

### **Progressive Enhancement**
- Each component provides value independently
- Features enhance each other as they're completed
- System remains functional even with incomplete features

## Integration Checkpoints

### **Week 1 Checkpoint**: Foundation Ready
- [ ] Database schema complete and migrated
- [ ] Basic BullMQ queues operational
- [ ] API contracts defined and documented
- [ ] Frontend component structure established

### **Week 2 Checkpoint**: Core Features Working
- [ ] CRUD endpoints functional
- [ ] Claude Code wrapper processing tasks
- [ ] Dashboard displaying static task information
- [ ] Basic task creation and monitoring working

### **Week 3 Checkpoint**: Real-time System Complete
- [ ] WebSocket events streaming live updates
- [ ] Dashboard showing real-time progress
- [ ] Live log streaming from Claude Code
- [ ] Complete task lifecycle visible in UI

## Success Metrics

### **Development Velocity**
- All specs can begin requirements → design → tasks phases immediately
- 6 specifications completed in parallel vs sequential development time
- Reduced integration time through contract-first development

### **Quality Assurance**
- Type safety maintained across all integration points
- Contract testing prevents integration failures
- Independent testing of each component before integration

### **Risk Mitigation**
- No single point of failure blocking entire development
- Workers can pivot between specs if blocked
- Incremental delivery provides early value and feedback

## Next Steps

1. **Await Approval**: database-schema-completion requirements pending approval
2. **Complete Spec-Workflow**: Create design.md and tasks.md for all specs
3. **Assign Workers**: Match specialist skills to spec requirements
4. **Establish Contracts**: Define and document all integration interfaces
5. **Begin Parallel Development**: Start all foundation-level specs simultaneously

This parallel development plan enables multiple workers to contribute simultaneously while maintaining system integrity and minimizing integration complexity.
