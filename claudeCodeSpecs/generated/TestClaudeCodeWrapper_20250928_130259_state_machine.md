# ClaudeCodeWrapper State Machine\n\nThis state machine represents the behavioral states and transitions for the Claude Code wrapper.\n\n## States (4)\n\n- **cancelled** (Error)\n- **completed** (Final)\n- **executing** (Normal)\n- **idle** (Final)\n\n## Transitions (5)\n\n- idle → executing on `run_started` (observed 2x)\n- executing → completed on `run_completed` [reason=ok, outcome=completed]\n- completed → idle on `state`\n- executing → cancelled on `run_cancelled` [outcome=cancelled]\n- cancelled → idle on `state`
