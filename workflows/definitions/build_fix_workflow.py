Build Fix Workflow Implementation

This module implements the BuildFixWorkflow class that automates fixing build errors
until compilation succeeds. It supports various build systems including npm, webpack,
make, cargo, and others through configurable build commands.

Classes:
    BuildFixWorkflow: Concrete implementation for build error resolution automation

The implementation follows the FR2 requirement for build fix workflow type, providing
automated build error analysis and resolution with reliable completion detection.

        prompt = f"""Fix build errors in this project until compilation succeeds.

OBJECTIVE: Analyze and fix all build errors in the codebase systematically.

WORKFLOW:
1. Run build to identify failures: `{self.config.build_command}`
2. Analyze each build error carefully:
   - Read compilation error messages and warnings
   - Examine stack traces and file locations
   - Identify the root cause (syntax errors, missing dependencies, configuration issues)
3. Fix the underlying issues:
   - Implement necessary code changes to resolve compilation errors
   - Update configuration files if needed (tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js, etc.)
   - Install missing dependencies if required
   - Ensure fixes don't introduce new issues
4. Re-run build to verify fixes: `{self.config.build_command}`
5. Repeat until build succeeds completely

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Focus on fixing actual compilation errors, not just warnings
- Read and understand error messages carefully before making changes
- Make minimal, targeted fixes rather than broad changes
- Run builds frequently to verify progress
- Pay attention to dependency issues and version conflicts
- Ensure type safety and maintain code quality
- Check for configuration file issues (tsconfig, webpack, babel, etc.)

COMMON BUILD ERROR TYPES:
- Syntax errors in source code
- Type errors in TypeScript projects
- Missing or incorrect imports/exports
- Dependency version conflicts
- Configuration file issues
- Missing build tools or plugins
- Environment variable problems

COMPLETION CRITERIA:
- Build completes successfully
- No compilation errors remain
- Build command exits with success status
- All necessary output files are generated

BUILD COMMAND: {self.config.build_command}

Begin by running the build to see current errors, then systematically fix each issue."""
