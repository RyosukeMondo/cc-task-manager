# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BullMQ Integration feature provides robust, Redis-backed job queue processing for the Claude Code Task Manager. This feature implements reliable task scheduling, execution, retry mechanisms, and distributed processing capabilities. It serves as the core infrastructure for managing Claude Code task execution with enterprise-grade reliability and observability.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports several key product objectives:
- **Task Queue System**: Background job processing with BullMQ for reliable task scheduling and execution
- **System Reliability**: Achieve 99.9% task completion rate with automatic retry mechanisms
- **Scalability**: Support concurrent execution of 50+ Claude Code tasks per instance
- **Automatic Recovery**: Robust error handling with automatic retries and failure recovery mechanisms

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable task queue processing, so that Claude Code tasks execute consistently even under high load or system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are submitted to the queue THEN the system SHALL persist them in Redis with proper priority and scheduling
2. IF worker processes crash THEN tasks SHALL be automatically reassigned to healthy workers without data loss
3. WHEN the system restarts THEN all pending tasks SHALL be restored and resume processing from their last known state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a task manager user, I want automatic retry mechanisms, so that temporary failures don't prevent my tasks from completing successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task fails due to temporary issues THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
2. IF retry attempts are exhausted THEN the system SHALL move tasks to a dead letter queue with detailed failure information
3. WHEN tasks succeed after retries THEN the system SHALL record the retry count and final success status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want queue monitoring and management, so that I can observe system health and intervene when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queue operations occur THEN the system SHALL provide real-time metrics on queue depth, processing rates, and worker health
2. IF queue issues are detected THEN the system SHALL emit alerts and provide diagnostic information
3. WHEN manual intervention is needed THEN the system SHALL support queue manipulation operations (pause, resume, retry, remove)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want distributed processing capabilities, so that the system can scale horizontally to handle increased task loads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple worker instances are deployed THEN tasks SHALL be distributed efficiently across all available workers
2. IF worker capacity varies THEN the system SHALL balance load based on worker capability and current processing load
3. WHEN workers are added or removed THEN the system SHALL automatically rebalance without interrupting running tasks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want task priority and scheduling control, so that critical tasks can be processed before less important ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are submitted with priority levels THEN the system SHALL process higher priority tasks first
2. IF scheduled tasks are defined THEN the system SHALL execute them at the specified times with accurate timing
3. WHEN task dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL respect execution order and dependency relationships

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each queue processor handles a specific task type with clear boundaries
- **Modular Design**: Queue definitions, processors, and monitoring components cleanly separated
- **Dependency Management**: BullMQ integration isolated from business logic with adapter pattern
- **Clear Interfaces**: Type-safe job definitions and processor interfaces using TypeScript generics

### Performance
- **Processing Throughput**: System SHALL process 1000+ tasks per hour per worker instance
- **Queue Response Time**: Task submission SHALL complete within 10ms for queue acknowledgment
- **Worker Efficiency**: Workers SHALL maintain >90% CPU utilization during active processing periods
- **Memory Management**: Queue operations SHALL use <100MB memory per worker under normal load

### Security
- **Redis Security**: Queue connections SHALL use authenticated Redis instances with proper access controls
- **Task Isolation**: Individual tasks SHALL execute in isolated environments preventing cross-task interference
- **Data Protection**: Task payloads SHALL be sanitized and validated before processing
- **Process Security**: Worker processes SHALL run with minimal privileges and secure execution contexts

### Reliability
- **Failure Recovery**: System SHALL recover from Redis connection failures within 30 seconds
- **Data Durability**: Task data SHALL be persisted to disk with Redis AOF for crash recovery
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Workers SHALL complete current tasks before shutdown and preserve queue state
- **Error Boundaries**: Individual task failures SHALL not affect other tasks or system stability

### Usability
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Queue status SHALL be visible through web-based monitoring interface
- **Logging Integration**: All queue operations SHALL be logged with structured format for analysis
- **Metrics Export**: Queue metrics SHALL be available in Prometheus format for monitoring systems
- **Developer Tools**: Queue inspection and debugging tools SHALL be available for development environments
