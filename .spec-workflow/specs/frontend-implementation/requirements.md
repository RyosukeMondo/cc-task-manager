# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a modern Next.js frontend application for the Claude Code Task Manager. The frontend will serve as the primary user interface for managing AI-powered tasks, providing real-time monitoring, interactive dashboards, and seamless integration with the backend API. This implementation follows SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion), SLAP (Single Level of Abstraction Principle), SSOT (Single Source of Truth), and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles while utilizing industry-standard libraries for optimal user experience and maintainability.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This frontend implementation directly supports the product vision by:
- **AI-First Architecture**: Creating user interfaces optimized for Claude Code task management workflows with intuitive task creation, monitoring, and result viewing
- **Real-time Transparency**: Implementing WebSocket client connections for instant task status updates and live progress monitoring without manual refresh
- **Fail-Safe Operations**: Building resilient frontend error handling, offline capability, and graceful degradation when backend services are unavailable
- **Developer Experience**: Providing type-safe components, excellent error states, and comprehensive accessibility support for all users
- **Production Ready**: Ensuring performance optimization, security best practices, and scalable component architecture suitable for enterprise deployment

5. WHEN dashboard components load THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading and skeleton states for optimal perceived performance

### Requirement 4: Authentication and Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication with persistent sessions and role-based interface adaptation, so that I can access the system securely with appropriate permissions and seamless user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log in THEN the system SHALL authenticate using JWT tokens with secure storage and automatic refresh
2. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the interface immediately reflecting user permissions and available features
3. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL handle renewal gracefully or redirect to login with preserved navigation state
4. WHEN users have different roles THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface showing only authorized features following Dependency Inversion Principle
5. WHEN users log out THEN the system SHALL clear all sensitive data and redirect securely to the login page

### Requirement 5: Offline Capability and Error Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work gracefully during network issues and backend downtime, so that I can continue viewing cached data and receive clear feedback about system status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connections are lost THEN the system SHALL display offline indicators and maintain basic functionality with cached data
2. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff and user feedback
3. WHEN backend services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully showing cached content and offline capabilities
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with actionable recovery suggestions
5. WHEN connectivity returns THEN the system SHALL synchronize pending operations and refresh stale data automatically

### Requirement 6: Performance and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want a high-performance application that meets WCAG standards, so that I can use all features effectively regardless of my abilities or assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN the system SHALL achieve Core Web Vitals metrics with LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, and CLS < 0.1
2. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading and code splitting for optimal bundle sizes
3. WHEN users navigate THEN the system SHALL provide ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation support
4. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL announce dynamic content changes and maintain logical focus management
5. WHEN users interact with forms THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation feedback and error announcements

### Requirement 7: Theming and Customization

**User Story:** As a user, I want customizable themes and interface preferences, so that I can adapt the application appearance to my preferences and working environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access theme settings THEN the system SHALL provide light/dark mode toggle with system preference detection
2. WHEN themes change THEN the system SHALL apply styling consistently across all components using CSS variables and Tailwind CSS
3. WHEN user preferences are set THEN the system SHALL persist settings locally and sync across browser sessions
4. WHEN components are styled THEN the system SHALL use Shadcn/ui components ensuring consistent design language following Open/Closed Principle
5. WHEN accessibility features are needed THEN the system SHALL support high contrast modes and reduced motion preferences

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each React component, hook, and utility has one reason to change and handles a single concern
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Components are open for extension through composition and props but closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Component variants and implementations are fully substitutable without breaking functionality
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Props interfaces are specific to component needs, avoiding forced dependencies on unused properties
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Components depend on abstractions (hooks, context) rather than concrete implementations
- **Single Level of Abstraction Principle (SLAP)**: Each component and function operates at a single level of abstraction
- **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**: Zod schemas define types, validation, and API contracts shared between frontend and backend
- **Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)**: Component design prioritizes simplicity and clarity over complex patterns
