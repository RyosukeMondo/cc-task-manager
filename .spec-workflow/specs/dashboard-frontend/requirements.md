# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dashboard Frontend feature provides a modern, responsive web interface for managing Claude Code tasks in real-time. This feature delivers intuitive task visualization, live progress monitoring, and comprehensive system health displays through a React-based dashboard built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It serves as the primary user interface for task management and system monitoring.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports several key product objectives:
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live status updates via WebSocket connections showing task progress, logs, and state changes
- **User Experience**: Provide real-time visibility into AI task execution with sub-second update latency
- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce manual monitoring overhead by 80% through automated task management
- **Dashboard Type**: Modern web-based interface with responsive design for desktop and mobile access

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a task manager user, I want a comprehensive dashboard overview, so that I can quickly understand system status and active task progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display active task count, queue status, and system health metrics
2. IF tasks are running THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress indicators with completion percentages
3. WHEN system issues occur THEN the dashboard SHALL highlight problems with clear visual indicators and actionable information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed task management interfaces, so that I can create, monitor, and control Claude Code tasks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating tasks THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive forms with validation feedback and helpful guidance
2. IF task parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages with suggestions for correction
3. WHEN tasks are submitted THEN the system SHALL immediately show them in the task list with pending status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a monitoring user, I want real-time task progress visualization, so that I can track execution status and identify potential issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks execute THEN the system SHALL stream live progress updates with <100ms latency
2. IF tasks generate logs THEN the system SHALL display them in real-time with syntax highlighting and filtering options
3. WHEN task status changes THEN the system SHALL update visual indicators immediately without requiring page refresh

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want task history and analytics, so that I can analyze performance patterns and optimize system usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing task history THEN the system SHALL provide searchable, filterable lists with comprehensive execution metadata
2. IF performance analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL display charts showing execution times, success rates, and resource usage
3. WHEN historical data is accessed THEN the system SHALL load efficiently with pagination and lazy loading for large datasets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want responsive dashboard access, so that I can monitor tasks and system status from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing from mobile devices THEN the dashboard SHALL adapt layout for optimal touch interaction and readability
2. IF screen space is limited THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical information and provide collapsible detail sections
3. WHEN network conditions vary THEN the dashboard SHALL maintain functionality with progressive enhancement and offline indicators

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component handles a specific UI concern with clear prop interfaces
- **Modular Design**: Dashboard components, UI primitives, and business logic clearly separated
- **Dependency Management**: Frontend state management isolated from API concerns using TanStack Query
- **Clear Interfaces**: TypeScript interfaces define all component contracts and API response types

### Performance
- **Initial Load Time**: Dashboard SHALL load within 2 seconds on 3G connections
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket updates SHALL render within 100ms of receiving data
- **Memory Usage**: Client-side memory SHALL remain under 100MB during extended usage sessions
- **Bundle Size**: JavaScript bundle SHALL be under 500KB gzipped for fast loading

### Security
- **Authentication Integration**: Dashboard SHALL require valid JWT tokens and handle token refresh seamlessly
- **XSS Prevention**: All user input SHALL be properly sanitized and escaped in rendered output
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All dashboard communication SHALL use HTTPS with proper certificate validation
- **Content Security Policy**: Dashboard SHALL implement CSP headers preventing script injection attacks

### Reliability
- **Error Boundaries**: Component failures SHALL be contained and display helpful error messages
- **Network Resilience**: Dashboard SHALL handle network interruptions gracefully with retry mechanisms
- **State Recovery**: Application state SHALL be preserved during page refreshes and navigation
- **WebSocket Reconnection**: Real-time connections SHALL automatically reconnect after temporary disconnections

### Usability
- **Accessibility**: Dashboard SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Loading States**: All async operations SHALL show appropriate loading indicators and skeleton screens
- **Error Feedback**: User actions SHALL provide immediate visual feedback with clear success/error states
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power users SHALL have keyboard shortcuts for common operations and navigation
