# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Real-time WebSocket Events feature provides instant, bidirectional communication between the frontend dashboard and backend services for live task monitoring and system updates. This feature implements Socket.IO-based real-time communication with room-based targeting, automatic reconnection, and structured event handling to deliver sub-100ms update latency for optimal user experience.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports several key product objectives:
- **Real-time Updates**: < 100ms WebSocket update delivery time for task status changes
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live status updates via WebSocket connections showing task progress, logs, and state changes
- **User Experience**: Provide real-time visibility into AI task execution with sub-second update latency
- **Real-time Transparency**: Users should never wonder about task status - all information is immediately available

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want instant task status updates, so that I can monitor task progress without manual refreshing or polling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN task status changes THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to connected clients within 100ms
2. IF multiple users are monitoring THEN each SHALL receive updates only for tasks they have permission to view
3. WHEN new tasks are created THEN subscribed clients SHALL immediately see them appear in their task lists

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want real-time system health monitoring, so that I can detect and respond to issues immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system metrics change THEN the dashboard SHALL update health indicators in real-time
2. IF critical issues occur THEN the system SHALL immediately broadcast alerts to administrative users
3. WHEN queue depths change THEN monitoring interfaces SHALL reflect current status without delay

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want live log streaming, so that I can debug task execution in real-time without checking files manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks generate logs THEN the system SHALL stream them to connected clients immediately
2. IF log volume is high THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure and buffering to prevent connection overload
3. WHEN log streaming is active THEN users SHALL be able to filter and search logs in real-time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want reliable WebSocket connections, so that I receive updates even with unstable network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connections drop THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and resume event streaming
2. IF reconnection occurs THEN the system SHALL catch up on missed events since disconnection
3. WHEN connection quality varies THEN the system SHALL adapt message frequency to maintain stability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a multi-user team, I want collaborative real-time features, so that team members can coordinate task management effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN team members work concurrently THEN each SHALL see others' actions reflected in real-time
2. IF conflicts might occur THEN the system SHALL provide awareness indicators and conflict resolution
3. WHEN permissions change THEN affected users SHALL immediately gain or lose access to relevant real-time updates

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each event handler manages a specific type of real-time communication
- **Modular Design**: WebSocket gateway, event routing, and client management clearly separated
- **Dependency Management**: Real-time layer isolated from business logic with event-driven architecture
- **Clear Interfaces**: Type-safe event definitions and handler interfaces using TypeScript

### Performance
- **Message Latency**: Events SHALL be delivered to clients within 100ms of occurrence
- **Connection Scaling**: System SHALL support 500+ concurrent WebSocket connections per instance
- **Memory Efficiency**: WebSocket connections SHALL use <10MB memory per connected client
- **Event Throughput**: System SHALL handle 10,000+ events per minute without performance degradation

### Security
- **Authentication**: WebSocket connections SHALL require valid JWT tokens for initial handshake
- **Authorization**: Event subscription SHALL be restricted based on user permissions and data access rights
- **Rate Limiting**: Clients SHALL be limited to prevent spam and ensure fair resource usage
- **Message Validation**: All incoming WebSocket messages SHALL be validated and sanitized

### Reliability
- **Connection Recovery**: Disconnected clients SHALL automatically reconnect within 5 seconds
- **Message Delivery**: Critical events SHALL be delivered with at-least-once guarantee through acknowledgments
- **Error Handling**: WebSocket errors SHALL be gracefully handled without disrupting other connections
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Server shutdown SHALL properly close all connections with appropriate status codes

### Usability
- **Connection Status**: Clients SHALL display clear indicators of WebSocket connection health
- **Offline Handling**: Application SHALL function gracefully when real-time features are unavailable
- **Event History**: Recent events SHALL be available to newly connected clients for context
- **Debug Support**: Development tools SHALL provide WebSocket message inspection and debugging capabilities
