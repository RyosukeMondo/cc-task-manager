# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Claude Code Wrapper Integration feature provides seamless integration between the task manager and Claude Code SDK through a standardized STDIO interface. This feature implements the documented Claude Code wrapper specification, enabling reliable AI-powered task execution with structured communication, process monitoring, and comprehensive error handling.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports several key product objectives:
- **AI Integration**: Claude Code SDK via Python wrapper for intelligent task execution
- **System Reliability**: Achieve 99.9% task completion rate with robust process management
- **AI-First Architecture**: Every feature designed around optimizing Claude Code integration
- **Fail-Safe Operations**: System automatically recovers from failures without data loss

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a worker process, I want standardized Claude Code communication, so that I can execute AI tasks reliably using the documented STDIO interface specification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are submitted THEN the system SHALL communicate with Claude Code using JSON-based STDIO protocol
2. IF Claude Code responds THEN the system SHALL parse all documented event types (ready, run_started, stream, run_completed, etc.)
3. WHEN communication errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide detailed error context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a task manager user, I want reliable AI task execution, so that my Claude Code tasks complete successfully with proper error recovery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI tasks execute THEN the system SHALL monitor process health and detect failures immediately
2. IF Claude Code processes crash THEN the system SHALL restart them automatically and resume task execution
3. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL preserve all execution logs and results for future reference

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want process isolation and monitoring, so that Claude Code tasks run securely without affecting system stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple tasks execute THEN each SHALL run in isolated processes preventing cross-task interference
2. IF resource limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL enforce constraints and terminate runaway processes
3. WHEN process monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL track CPU, memory, and execution time metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured task results, so that I can process Claude Code outputs programmatically with type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks produce output THEN the system SHALL capture structured data according to documented schemas
2. IF real-time streaming is active THEN the system SHALL forward Claude Code stream events with proper formatting
3. WHEN tasks finish THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive execution metadata including timing and resource usage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a monitoring user, I want wrapper health visibility, so that I can track Claude Code integration performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wrapper processes are active THEN the system SHALL provide real-time health status and performance metrics
2. IF integration issues occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed diagnostics and error traces
3. WHEN historical analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain execution logs with searchable metadata

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Wrapper integration isolated from business logic with clear adapter interfaces
- **Modular Design**: Process management, communication protocol, and monitoring components clearly separated
- **Dependency Management**: Claude Code integration abstracted behind interfaces for testability
- **Clear Interfaces**: Type-safe communication contracts based on documented STDIO specification

### Performance
- **Process Startup Time**: Claude Code processes SHALL initialize within 5 seconds
- **Communication Latency**: STDIO message exchange SHALL complete within 50ms
- **Memory Efficiency**: Wrapper processes SHALL use <256MB memory per task execution
- **Concurrent Tasks**: System SHALL support 50+ simultaneous Claude Code processes

### Security
- **Process Isolation**: Each Claude Code task SHALL execute in sandboxed environment with limited system access
- **Input Sanitization**: All task inputs SHALL be validated and sanitized before passing to Claude Code
- **Output Validation**: Claude Code responses SHALL be validated against expected schemas
- **Privilege Separation**: Wrapper processes SHALL run with minimal required permissions

### Reliability
- **Process Recovery**: Failed Claude Code processes SHALL be restarted automatically within 10 seconds
- **State Preservation**: Task execution state SHALL be preserved during process restarts
- **Error Handling**: All communication errors SHALL be captured with detailed context for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: System SHALL remain functional even when some wrapper processes fail

### Usability
- **Debugging Support**: Wrapper communication SHALL be logged with structured format for troubleshooting
- **Status Transparency**: Process health and execution status SHALL be visible through monitoring interfaces
- **Configuration Management**: Wrapper behavior SHALL be configurable through environment variables and settings
- **Error Reporting**: Clear error messages SHALL be provided for common integration issues
