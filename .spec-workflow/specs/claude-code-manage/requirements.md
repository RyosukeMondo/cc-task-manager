# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Claude Code Manage feature provides a minimal worker system that can invoke, monitor, and control Claude Code SDK processes. This is a feasibility test to validate the core architecture before implementing a full-featured task management system. The worker demonstrates the essential capabilities: process spawning, state monitoring, and lifecycle management of Claude Code executions.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature serves as the foundational proof-of-concept for the larger vision of an automated AI task management system. By implementing the core worker functionality first, we validate that:
- Claude Code SDK can be reliably invoked from Node.js workers
- Process state can be accurately monitored in real-time
- Worker processes can be safely started, stopped, and recovered
- The architectural patterns from the technical research are viable

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Claude Code Process Invocation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to invoke Claude Code processes through a worker, so that I can execute AI tasks programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is submitted to the worker THEN the system SHALL spawn a Claude Code process using child_process.spawn
2. WHEN spawning the process THEN the system SHALL use a Python wrapper script to interface with the Claude Code SDK
3. WHEN the process starts THEN the system SHALL record the PID for monitoring purposes
4. IF the spawn operation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and mark the task as failed
5. WHEN passing data to Claude Code THEN the system SHALL send prompts via stdin to handle complex inputs safely

### Requirement 2: Real-time Process Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor Claude Code process status in real-time, so that I can detect failures and track progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Claude Code process is running THEN the system SHALL monitor the PID for process existence
2. WHEN the process outputs to stdout THEN the system SHALL parse structured JSON messages for progress updates
3. WHEN the session file is updated THEN the system SHALL update the last activity timestamp
4. IF no activity is detected for 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL mark the process as potentially hung
5. WHEN process state changes THEN the system SHALL update the task status accordingly

### Requirement 3: Process Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control Claude Code process lifecycle, so that I can stop tasks and handle failures gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a stop request is received THEN the system SHALL send SIGTERM to the Claude Code process
2. WHEN SIGTERM is sent THEN the Python wrapper SHALL perform graceful cleanup and exit
3. IF the process doesn't stop within 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL send SIGKILL as fallback
4. WHEN a process exits THEN the system SHALL capture the exit code and any stderr output
5. IF a process crashes THEN the system SHALL log the failure details and mark the task as failed

### Requirement 4: Basic State Detection

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to detect Claude Code process states, so that I can understand what the system is doing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring processes THEN the system SHALL distinguish between running, idle, active, and failed states
2. WHEN a process is spawned THEN the state SHALL be "running"
3. WHEN stdout activity is detected THEN the state SHALL be "active"
4. IF no activity for timeout period THEN the state SHALL be "idle" or "hung"
5. WHEN process exits with code 0 THEN the state SHALL be "completed"
6. WHEN process exits with non-zero code THEN the state SHALL be "failed"

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Worker, process manager, and monitor components should be separate modules
- **Modular Design**: Python wrapper, Node.js worker, and monitoring logic should be independently testable
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between process spawning and monitoring logic
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between worker and Claude Code SDK integration

### Performance
- Process spawning should complete within 5 seconds under normal conditions
- State monitoring should update within 1 second of actual state changes
- Memory usage should remain under 100MB per worker process
- CPU usage should not exceed 10% when idle

### Security
- Never log sensitive data from Claude Code prompts or responses
- Use child_process.spawn to prevent command injection vulnerabilities
- Validate all input parameters before process spawning
- Ensure Python wrapper handles signals securely for graceful shutdown

### Reliability
- Worker must survive and report Claude Code process crashes
- Monitoring must continue working even if individual processes fail
- System should automatically clean up orphaned processes
- Error states must be clearly distinguished from normal operation

### Usability
- Clear logging of all process state changes with timestamps
- Structured JSON output for easy integration with monitoring systems
- Simple start/stop interface for manual testing
- Comprehensive error messages for troubleshooting
