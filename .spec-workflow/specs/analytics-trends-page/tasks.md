# Tasks Document - Analytics Trends Page

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Contract-First Development
Task 0 from analytics-performance-page spec MUST be completed first. The Analytics API contract defines all metrics and trend data structures that this page depends on.

- [x] 0. Verify Analytics API contract exists and supports trend data
  - File: packages/schemas/src/analytics/analytics.schemas.ts (verify)
  - Verify Analytics contract from analytics-performance-page Task 0 includes TimeSeriesDataSchema for trend visualization
  - Verify contract supports time period grouping (day/week/month)
  - Confirm TrendComparisonSchema exists for period-over-period analysis
  - Purpose: Ensure Analytics API contract supports trend analysis and time-series data before implementing Trends page
  - _Leverage: packages/schemas/src/analytics/ contract from analytics-performance-page Task 0_
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.1, 2.3_
  - _Prompt: Role: API Contract Verifier with expertise in time-series analytics and trend analysis | Task: Verify that the Analytics API contract supports trend functionality by confirming TimeSeriesDataSchema exists with timestamp, value, and category fields, AnalyticsFilterSchema supports groupBy field with options for 'day', 'week', 'month' time periods, contract includes TrendComparisonSchema for comparing current vs previous period metrics with percentage changes, contract supports aggregation of metrics over time periods, trend direction indicators (up/down/stable) are included - check packages/schemas/src/analytics/analytics.schemas.ts for time-series schemas, verify Zod validation includes proper date grouping logic, ensure JSDoc documents trend calculation methodology | Restrictions: Do not modify analytics-performance-page schemas unless trend support is completely missing, only verify trend analysis capabilities exist, if time-series or comparison schemas are inadequate document what needs to be added to analytics-performance-page Task 0, ensure groupBy validation includes all required time periods | Success: Analytics API contract confirmed to support trend analysis with TimeSeriesDataSchema, AnalyticsFilterSchema includes groupBy field with day/week/month options, TrendComparisonSchema exists for period comparisons, time-series data properly typed with timestamps, frontend can safely display trends and period comparisons using shared contract_

- [x] 1. Extend analytics types from shared schemas instead of defining new trend types
  - File: apps/frontend/src/types/analytics.ts (extend from task 1 of performance page)
  - Import additional trend-specific types from shared schemas if not already included
  - Re-export trend types: export type { TimeSeriesData, TrendComparison, AnalyticsFilter } from '@cc-task-manager/schemas'
  - Purpose: Ensure all trend-specific types from shared contract are accessible in frontend
  - _Leverage: packages/schemas/src/analytics/analytics.schemas.ts (from analytics-performance-page Task 0)_
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_
  - _Prompt: Role: TypeScript Developer specializing in contract-driven development | Task: Extend apps/frontend/src/types/analytics.ts to include trend-specific type re-exports from @cc-task-manager/schemas (if not already included from performance page task 1), ensuring TimeSeriesData, TrendComparison, and time-period-related types are accessible following requirements 1.1 and 1.4 | Restrictions: Must import from @cc-task-manager/schemas only, do not define any new types locally, only add re-exports for trend types if they weren't included in performance page type file, maintain compatibility with existing analytics type exports, verify all trend types are accessible | Success: All trend-specific types imported from shared schemas and re-exported, no duplicate type definitions, TypeScript compiles without errors, frontend has full type coverage for time-series and trend comparison data from shared contracts_

- [x] 2. Create useTrendData hook
  - File: apps/frontend/src/hooks/useTrendData.ts
  - Implement data fetching hook for trend data
  - Purpose: Centralize trend data management
  - _Leverage: usePerformanceMetrics pattern, API client_
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_
  - _Prompt: Role: React Developer | Task: Implement useTrendData custom hook following requirements 1.1 and 1.4, similar to usePerformanceMetrics pattern | Restrictions: Handle time period changes, implement caching, manage loading states | Success: Hook provides trend data with proper time period support and state management_

- [x] 3. Create trend charts component
  - File: apps/frontend/src/components/analytics/TrendCharts.tsx
  - Implement time-series charts for trend visualization
  - Purpose: Provide visual representation of trend data
  - _Leverage: Chart library, PerformanceCharts patterns, theme colors_
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_
  - _Prompt: Role: Data Visualization Developer | Task: Create TrendCharts component with time-series visualizations following requirements 2.1-2.4, leveraging chart library and existing patterns | Restrictions: Must support multiple time periods, show comparisons, ensure accessibility, use theme colors | Success: Trend charts render correctly, are interactive, show period comparisons, and are accessible_

- [ ] 4. Create time period selector component
  - File: apps/frontend/src/components/analytics/TimePeriodSelector.tsx
  - Implement selector for day/week/month views
  - Purpose: Allow users to switch between time period views
  - _Leverage: Button group or tabs component_
  - _Requirements: 2.3_
  - _Prompt: Role: Frontend Developer | Task: Create TimePeriodSelector component for switching between day/week/month views following requirement 2.3 | Restrictions: Must update URL state, provide clear visual feedback, follow design patterns | Success: Time period selector works correctly, updates charts, and maintains state_

- [ ] 5. Create trends page
  - File: apps/frontend/src/app/analytics/trends/page.tsx
  - Create page component integrating trend charts and selector
  - Purpose: Establish /analytics/trends route
  - _Leverage: TrendCharts, TimePeriodSelector, page layout patterns_
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1_
  - _Prompt: Role: Next.js Developer | Task: Create trends analytics page at apps/frontend/src/app/analytics/trends/page.tsx following requirements 1.1, 2.1, and 3.1, integrating trend components | Restrictions: Set proper metadata, follow page structure, handle all data states | Success: Page exists, displays trends correctly, navigation works without 404 error_

- [ ] 6. Verify Analytics navigation (already uncommented)
  - File: N/A (verification only)
  - Test that Analytics section shows both Performance and Trends links
  - Purpose: Ensure both analytics links work correctly
  - _Leverage: Navigation uncommented in performance page spec_
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
  - _Prompt: Role: QA Engineer | Task: Verify that Analytics section in Sidebar shows both Performance and Trends links and they navigate correctly following requirements 3.1-3.3 | Restrictions: Only verify, do not modify navigation | Success: Both analytics links work, navigate without errors, active states highlight correctly_

- [ ] 7. Add tests for trends page
  - File: apps/frontend/src/app/analytics/trends/__tests__/page.test.tsx
  - Write comprehensive tests for trends page
  - Purpose: Ensure page and trend visualizations work correctly
  - _Leverage: Existing test patterns, similar to performance page tests_
  - _Requirements: All requirements_
  - _Prompt: Role: QA Engineer | Task: Create comprehensive tests for trends analytics page covering all requirements | Restrictions: Mock chart rendering, test time period selection, follow test patterns | Success: Tests cover all page functionality, trend visualizations, and time period switching_
