## Validation Checklist

Before marking this spec as complete, verify:

- [ ] All 11 tasks marked as `[x]`
- [ ] All E2E tests passing (0 failures)
- [ ] Can navigate to /queue via sidebar
- [ ] Queue metrics display correctly (active, pending, completed, failed)
- [ ] Throughput chart shows last 24 hours
- [ ] Job list displays with pagination
- [ ] Can filter jobs by status
- [ ] Can retry failed jobs
- [ ] Can cancel pending/active jobs
- [ ] "Retry All Failed" works
- [ ] Polling updates data every 5 seconds
- [ ] Polling slows down when tab inactive (30s)
- [ ] Expandable rows show job data and errors

## Estimated Effort

- **Total Tasks**: 11
- **Estimated Time**: 7-9 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium-High (BullMQ integration, Recharts, polling)
- **Dependencies**: None (BullMQ already integrated in backend)

## Notes

- BullMQ is already integrated - just need to expose via API
- Polling is essential for near-real-time updates (WebSocket optional enhancement)
- Reduce polling frequency when tab inactive to save resources
- Virtual scrolling not needed (pagination limits to 20 jobs per page)
- Retry all failed jobs is critical for recovery from system-wide failures
- Throughput chart helps identify performance patterns
- Queue dashboard should be admin-only (consider adding role check)
- Monitor BullMQ memory usage in production (large job queues can consume RAM)
