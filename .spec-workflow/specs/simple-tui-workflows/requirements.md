# Simple TUI Workflows - Requirements

## Overview
Generalize the existing `spec_workflow_automation.py` into a flexible workflow system that can handle different automation scenarios with parametrized prompts and completion conditions.

## Core Requirements

### FR1: Workflow Abstraction
- Abstract base workflow class with common interface
- Parametrized prompt templates with variable substitution
- Pluggable completion detection strategies
- Configurable execution parameters (cycles, timeouts, debug options)

### FR2: Workflow Types
Support these initial workflow types:
- **Spec Workflow**: Existing spec-workflow task completion (migrate from current)
- **Test Fix**: Fix failing tests until all pass
- **Type Fix**: Fix TypeScript/type errors until clean
- **Build Fix**: Fix build errors until successful compilation
- **Critical Issues**: Fix linting/CI failures until clean

### FR3: Execution Engine
- Reuse existing `claude_wrapper.py` for Claude Code orchestration
- Session lifecycle management (start, monitor, cleanup)
- Error handling and graceful shutdown
- Debug logging with configurable verbosity

### FR4: Completion Detection
- Text pattern matching (existing approach)
- Command execution result validation (exit codes)
- Tool output parsing (JSON/structured data)
- Timeout-based completion for stuck processes

### FR5: Configuration System
- YAML/JSON workflow definitions
- Environment-specific overrides
- Runtime parameter configuration
- Debug and logging controls

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Modularity
- Single Responsibility Principle for each module
- Minimal interdependencies
- Easy to extend with new workflow types
- Clean separation of concerns

### NFR2: Maintainability
- Simple, readable code structure
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear logging and debugging
- Documentation for each component

### NFR3: Backward Compatibility
- Existing `spec_workflow_automation.py` functionality preserved
- Same CLI interface for spec workflows
- No breaking changes to current ecosystem integration

## Success Criteria
1. Current spec workflow functionality migrated without regression
2. At least 3 additional workflow types implemented and tested
3. New workflows can be added with <50 lines of configuration
4. System can handle parallel workflow execution (future enhancement)
5. Clear separation allows easy GUI integration later

## Out of Scope
- GUI interface (future enhancement)
- Parallel workflow execution
- Workflow scheduling/cron integration
- Advanced workflow orchestration (dependencies, conditions)
- Database persistence (memory-based state only)
