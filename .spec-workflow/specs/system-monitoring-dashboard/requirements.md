# Requirements Document - System Monitoring Dashboard

## Introduction

The System Monitoring Dashboard provides real-time visibility into system health metrics including CPU usage, memory consumption, API response times, and database connection pool status. This feature enables administrators to proactively identify performance issues and resource constraints.

**Purpose**: Implement `/monitoring` route with real-time system metrics visualization and health status indicators.

**Value**: Enables administrators to monitor system health, detect performance degradation early, and make informed decisions about scaling and optimization.

## Alignment with Product Vision

From `product.md`:
- **"System Health Metrics"**: Real-time CPU, memory, and resource usage monitoring
- **"Performance Monitoring"**: API response time tracking and database connection status
- **"Proactive Maintenance"**: Early warning system for resource exhaustion

This spec addresses the gap: "System health monitoring missing - no metrics dashboard, no resource usage visualization" (from IMPLEMENTATION_GAP_ANALYSIS.md)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: System Resource Metrics

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see real-time CPU and memory usage, so that I can detect resource exhaustion before it impacts users

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS)

1. WHEN user navigates to `/monitoring` THEN system SHALL display resource metrics cards
2. WHEN metrics are loaded THEN system SHALL show: CPU usage (%), memory usage (%), disk usage (%)
3. WHEN CPU usage exceeds 80% THEN system SHALL highlight metric in red with warning icon
4. WHEN memory usage exceeds 90% THEN system SHALL highlight metric in red with critical warning
5. WHEN metrics are current THEN system SHALL show last updated timestamp
6. WHEN metrics are stale (> 15s) THEN system SHALL show "Connection lost" warning

### Requirement 2: API Performance Metrics

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see API response time metrics, so that I can identify performance bottlenecks

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS)

1. WHEN monitoring page loads THEN system SHALL display API performance section
2. WHEN API metrics are shown THEN system SHALL include: average response time (ms), p95 response time, p99 response time, requests per second
3. WHEN p95 response time exceeds 500ms THEN system SHALL highlight metric in yellow (warning)
4. WHEN p99 response time exceeds 1000ms THEN system SHALL highlight metric in red (critical)
5. WHEN metrics are grouped THEN system SHALL show breakdown by endpoint (/api/tasks, /api/analytics, etc.)

### Requirement 3: Database Connection Pool Status

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see database connection pool status, so that I can detect connection leaks or pool exhaustion

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS)

1. WHEN monitoring page loads THEN system SHALL display database metrics card
2. WHEN database metrics are shown THEN system SHALL include: active connections, idle connections, pool size, queue depth
3. WHEN active connections equal pool size THEN system SHALL show warning "Connection pool at capacity"
4. WHEN queue depth > 0 THEN system SHALL show warning "Requests waiting for database connection"
5. WHEN database is unreachable THEN system SHALL show error "Database connection failed"

### Requirement 4: Real-time Metrics Charts

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see historical trends for CPU and memory, so that I can identify patterns over time

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS)

1. WHEN monitoring page loads THEN system SHALL display time-series charts for CPU and memory (last 1 hour)
2. WHEN charts are rendered THEN system SHALL use line chart with X-axis=time, Y-axis=percentage
3. WHEN charts show data THEN system SHALL update with new data points every 5 seconds
4. WHEN chart has 720 data points (1 hour at 5s intervals) THEN system SHALL drop oldest point (sliding window)
5. WHEN user hovers over chart point THEN system SHALL show tooltip with exact value and timestamp
6. WHEN no data exists THEN system SHALL show message "Collecting metrics..."

### Requirement 5: WebSocket Connection Status

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see WebSocket connection health, so that I can diagnose real-time communication issues

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS)

1. WHEN monitoring page loads THEN system SHALL display WebSocket status card
2. WHEN WebSocket is connected THEN system SHALL show green badge "Connected" with connection count
3. WHEN WebSocket is disconnected THEN system SHALL show red badge "Disconnected"
4. WHEN WebSocket connection count > 100 THEN system SHALL show info "High connection load"
5. WHEN metrics are shown THEN system SHALL include: connected clients, messages per second, average latency

### Requirement 6: Auto-refresh and Polling

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want metrics to refresh automatically, so that I see current system state without manual refresh

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS)

1. WHEN monitoring page loads THEN system SHALL poll GET /api/monitoring/metrics every 5 seconds
2. WHEN new metrics are received THEN system SHALL update all cards and charts without page reload
3. WHEN user is idle for 5 minutes THEN system SHALL reduce polling to 30 seconds
4. WHEN page is in background tab THEN system SHALL reduce polling to 60 seconds
5. WHEN page unmounts THEN system SHALL stop polling to prevent memory leaks
6. WHEN polling fails 3 times consecutively THEN system SHALL show error "Failed to fetch metrics"

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate SystemMetrics (cards), MetricsChart (charts), useSystemMetrics (polling)
- **Modular Design**: Components isolated in `src/components/monitoring/` and `src/app/monitoring/`
- **Dependency Management**: Use TanStack Query for polling, Recharts for charts, date-fns for time formatting
- **Clear Interfaces**: Props typed with TypeScript, metrics schemas from shared package
- **File Ownership**: This spec owns `app/monitoring/**/*`, `components/monitoring/**/*`, `hooks/useSystemMetrics.ts`

### Contract-Driven Development
- **Schema First**: Define Zod schemas in `@cc-task-manager/schemas/src/monitoring.schema.ts`
- **SSOT**: Metrics types generated from Zod schema
- **API Contract**: GET /api/monitoring/metrics matches contract-client.ts method
- **Backend Integration**: Backend uses Node.js `os` module for system metrics

### Performance
- **Polling Optimization**: Use TanStack Query's refetchInterval with smart backoff
- **Chart Performance**: Use Recharts with max 720 data points (1 hour sliding window)
- **Memoization**: Memoize chart data transformations
- **Bundle Size**: Use dynamic import for Recharts (code splitting)

### Security
- **Authorization**: Monitoring dashboard requires admin role (check backend)
- **Rate Limiting**: Backend enforces stricter rate limit (20 req/min) for monitoring endpoints
- **No Sensitive Data**: Never expose connection strings or secrets in metrics

### Reliability
- **Error Boundaries**: Catch component errors and show fallback UI
- **Retry Logic**: Auto-retry failed API requests (max 3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- **Offline Support**: Show cached metrics when offline with warning banner
- **Graceful Degradation**: If chart fails to render, still show metric cards

### Usability
- **Loading States**: Show skeletons during initial load
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: "F5" to force refresh metrics
- **Mobile Responsive**: Cards stack vertically, charts adapt to screen width
- **Color Coding**: Green=healthy, yellow=warning, red=critical

### Accessibility
- **ARIA Labels**: All metric cards have descriptive labels
- **Focus Management**: Keyboard-accessible metric cards
- **Screen Reader Support**: Metrics announce critical warnings (aria-live)
- **Color Contrast**: Warning/critical colors meet WCAG AA standards
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect prefers-reduced-motion for chart animations

### Testing
- **E2E Tests**: `apps/frontend/e2e/monitoring.spec.ts` validates full user flow
- **Test Coverage**: Metrics display, charts, polling, warning states, error handling
- **Visual Regression**: Screenshots for different health states (healthy, warning, critical)

### Environment-Driven Configuration
- **Feature Flag**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_MONITORING_DASHBOARD_ENABLED=true` to enable/disable route
- **Polling Interval**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_METRICS_POLL_INTERVAL=5000` (milliseconds)
- **Chart Retention**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_METRICS_RETENTION=3600` (seconds, 1 hour)
- **Admin Access**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_REQUIRE_ADMIN_ROLE=true` for monitoring dashboard

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Administrators can view real-time system metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- ✅ API performance metrics show response times and throughput
- ✅ Database connection pool status prevents connection leaks
- ✅ Charts show historical trends for pattern identification
- ✅ Warning states clearly highlight resource issues
- ✅ Dashboard updates automatically without page refresh
- ✅ E2E tests validate complete monitoring workflow
