# Requirements Document - Analytics Performance Page

## Introduction

The performance analytics page (/analytics/performance) provides users with insights into task performance metrics, completion times, and efficiency statistics.

## Alignment with Product Vision

Supports data-driven task management by providing actionable insights into task performance and helping users optimize their workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Display Performance Metrics

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see task performance metrics, so that I can understand my efficiency and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to /analytics/performance THEN I SHALL see key performance indicators (KPIs)
2. WHEN metrics are loading THEN I SHALL see loading skeletons
3. WHEN no data exists THEN I SHALL see an appropriate empty state
4. WHEN metrics update THEN the display SHALL refresh automatically

### Requirement 2: Visualize Performance Data

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual representations of performance data, so that I can quickly understand trends and patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the page THEN I SHALL see charts/graphs of performance metrics
2. WHEN hovering over charts THEN I SHALL see detailed tooltips
3. WHEN charts render THEN they SHALL be accessible and responsive
4. WHEN date range is selected THEN charts SHALL update accordingly

### Requirement 3: Page Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the performance page from navigation, so that I can easily view my analytics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Analytics section is uncommented THEN Performance link SHALL be visible
2. WHEN I click Performance link THEN /analytics/performance SHALL load without 404
3. WHEN I am on the page THEN the navigation link SHALL be highlighted

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- Separate chart components for reusability
- Data fetching hooks separate from UI components
- Chart library agnostic (can swap visualization library)

### Performance
- Efficient data aggregation on backend
- Chart rendering optimized for large datasets
- Lazy loading for chart components

### Accessibility
- Charts have text alternatives
- Color schemes are colorblind-friendly
- Keyboard navigation for chart interactions

### Usability
- Intuitive data visualization
- Clear metric labels and descriptions
- Responsive charts that work on all devices
