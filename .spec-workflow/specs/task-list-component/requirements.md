# Requirements Document - Task List Component

## Introduction

A reusable React component for displaying task lists with various states and filtering capabilities. This component serves as the foundation for all task-related pages and provides a consistent user experience across the application.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This component supports the core functionality of task management by providing a reusable, consistent interface for displaying and interacting with tasks across different contexts (all tasks, active tasks, completed tasks).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Display Task List

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my tasks in a clear, organized list, so that I can quickly understand my workload and task statuses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component receives task data THEN it SHALL render tasks in a list format
2. WHEN tasks are loading THEN the component SHALL display a loading skeleton/indicator
3. WHEN no tasks exist THEN the component SHALL display an empty state message
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the component SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: Task Item Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see task details at a glance, so that I can quickly understand what each task involves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a task THEN it SHALL show title, description, status, and timestamps
2. WHEN a task has a priority THEN it SHALL be visually indicated
3. WHEN a task is clickable THEN it SHALL provide visual feedback on hover/focus
4. WHEN tasks have different statuses THEN they SHALL be visually distinguishable

### Requirement 3: Filtering and Sorting

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter and sort my tasks, so that I can focus on what's most important.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a filter is applied THEN the component SHALL only display matching tasks
2. WHEN a sort option is selected THEN tasks SHALL be reordered accordingly
3. WHEN filters change THEN the list SHALL update without full page reload
4. WHEN no tasks match filters THEN an appropriate message SHALL be displayed

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Component should only handle task list display and user interactions
- **Modular Design**: Separate TaskItem sub-component for individual task rendering
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize dependencies, leverage existing UI components
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined props interface with TypeScript

### Performance
- Efficiently render large lists (100+ tasks) without performance degradation
- Use React memoization for task items to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement virtual scrolling for lists exceeding 100 items

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly with proper ARIA labels
- Focus management for interactive elements

### Usability
- Responsive design working on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Intuitive visual hierarchy
- Clear feedback for all user actions
- Consistent with existing design system
