# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Task CRUD API feature provides comprehensive REST endpoints for task lifecycle management in the Claude Code Task Manager. This feature enables creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks with full validation, real-time notifications, and integration with the task processing queue. It serves as the primary interface between the frontend dashboard and backend task management system.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports several key product objectives:
- **AI Task Management**: Create, execute, and monitor Claude Code tasks with full lifecycle management
- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce manual monitoring overhead through automated task management APIs
- **System Reliability**: Achieve 99.9% task completion rate with robust error handling and validation
- **Response Time**: < 200ms API response times for 95th percentile requests

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want comprehensive task CRUD endpoints, so that I can build intuitive task management interfaces with full lifecycle control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task creation request is made THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields and return a properly typed task object
2. IF invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return detailed validation errors with field-specific messages
3. WHEN a task is created THEN the system SHALL automatically enqueue it for processing and emit real-time events

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a task manager user, I want to retrieve my tasks with filtering and pagination, so that I can efficiently manage large numbers of tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are requested THEN the system SHALL support filtering by status, user, date range, and task type
2. IF pagination is requested THEN the system SHALL return results with proper pagination metadata and cursor-based navigation
3. WHEN task lists are fetched THEN the system SHALL include execution progress and real-time status information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to update task configurations, so that I can modify execution parameters without recreating tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task update is requested THEN the system SHALL validate changes against current task status and constraints
2. IF a task is currently executing THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicting updates and return appropriate error messages
3. WHEN task updates are applied THEN the system SHALL preserve execution history and emit update notifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a task manager user, I want to cancel or delete tasks, so that I can manage my task queue and prevent unwanted executions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task deletion is requested THEN the system SHALL handle graceful cancellation if the task is currently executing
2. IF a task has completed THEN the system SHALL preserve execution logs while removing the task configuration
3. WHEN tasks are cancelled THEN the system SHALL cleanup associated resources and notify connected clients

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a monitoring user, I want detailed task status information, so that I can track execution progress and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN task status is requested THEN the system SHALL provide real-time execution state, progress percentage, and log streaming
2. IF errors occur during execution THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information and stack traces
3. WHEN task history is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide complete execution timeline with performance metrics

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each endpoint handles a single task operation with clear input/output contracts
- **Modular Design**: Controllers, services, and repositories clearly separated with dependency injection
- **Dependency Management**: Minimal coupling between API layer and business logic implementation
- **Clear Interfaces**: Zod schemas provide single source of truth for validation and TypeScript types

### Performance
- **Response Time**: API endpoints SHALL respond within 200ms for 95th percentile requests
- **Concurrent Requests**: System SHALL handle 100+ concurrent API requests without performance degradation
- **Database Optimization**: Complex queries SHALL use proper indexing and optimization for sub-50ms execution
- **Caching Strategy**: Frequently accessed data SHALL be cached to reduce database load

### Security
- **Authentication**: All endpoints SHALL require valid JWT tokens with proper user identification
- **Authorization**: Users SHALL only access tasks they own or have been granted permission to view
- **Input Validation**: All request data SHALL be validated using Zod schemas preventing injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage

### Reliability
- **Error Handling**: All endpoints SHALL provide consistent error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- **Transaction Safety**: Multi-step operations SHALL use database transactions ensuring data consistency
- **Idempotency**: Update and delete operations SHALL be idempotent to handle retry scenarios safely
- **Graceful Degradation**: API SHALL remain functional even when dependent services are temporarily unavailable

### Usability
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: All endpoints SHALL be documented with auto-generated OpenAPI specifications
- **Type Safety**: Request/response types SHALL be automatically generated from Zod schemas
- **Consistent Format**: All responses SHALL follow consistent JSON structure with proper error formatting
- **Developer Experience**: API SHALL provide clear error messages and validation feedback for debugging
