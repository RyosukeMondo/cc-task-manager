The backend will serve as the API gateway and orchestration layer, providing REST endpoints, real-time WebSocket communication, task queue management, and database operations. This implementation follows SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion), SLAP (Single Level of Abstraction Principle), SSOT (Single Source of Truth), and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles while utilizing industry-standard libraries for reliability and maintainability.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis backend implementation directly supports the product vision by:\n- **AI-First Architecture**: Providing robust API endpoints optimized for Claude Code task management and workflow orchestration\n- **Real-time Transparency**: Implementing WebSocket gateways for instant task status updates and progress monitoring\n- **Fail-Safe Operations**: Building comprehensive error handling, automatic retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation patterns\n- **Developer Experience**: Creating type-safe, well-documented APIs with excellent error messages and development tooling\n- **Production Ready**: Ensuring enterprise-grade reliability, observability, and security through industry-standard libraries and patterns\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Core API Infrastructure\n\n**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a well-structured REST API with comprehensive error handling and validation, so that I can build reliable user interfaces that communicate effectively with the backend services.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the backend application starts THEN it SHALL expose REST API endpoints on a configurable port (default: 3001)\n2. WHEN API requests are received THEN the system SHALL validate all input data using type-safe schemas following SSOT principle\n3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return standardized error responses with clear error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes\n4. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling following the Single Responsibility Principle\n5. WHEN API operations complete THEN the system SHALL return consistent response formats with proper status codes and structured data\n\n### Requirement 2: Authentication and Authorization System\n\n**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure JWT-based authentication with role-based access control, so that only authorized users can access the system and perform operations within their permissions.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN users submit valid credentials THEN the system SHALL generate and return a signed JWT token containing user identity and roles\n2. WHEN protected endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens and extract user context following Interface Segregation Principle\n3. WHEN authorization is required THEN the system SHALL implement attribute-based access control (ABAC) using CASL for fine-grained permissions\n4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 401 Unauthorized responses\n5. WHEN authorization fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 403 Forbidden responses with clear explanations\n\n### Requirement 3: Task Management API\n\n**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want comprehensive task management endpoints, so that users can create, monitor, update, and manage Claude Code tasks through the web interface.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN task creation requests are received THEN the system SHALL validate task data and enqueue jobs to BullMQ following KISS principle\n2. WHEN task status queries are made THEN the system SHALL return current task state from the database with real-time accuracy\n3. WHEN task operations are performed THEN the system SHALL ensure data consistency using database transactions\n4. WHEN task lists are requested THEN the system SHALL implement pagination, filtering, and sorting capabilities\n5. WHEN task updates occur THEN the system SHALL broadcast changes through WebSocket connections to connected clients\n\n### Requirement 4: Real-time Communication System\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates about task progress and system status, so that I can monitor long-running operations without manually refreshing the interface.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN users connect to the WebSocket endpoint THEN the system SHALL authenticate the connection using JWT tokens\n2. WHEN task status changes occur THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates only to authorized users following the Dependency Inversion Principle\n3. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN the system SHALL manage connection state and implement automatic reconnection support\n4. WHEN real-time events are triggered THEN the system SHALL implement room-based targeting for user-specific notifications\n5. WHEN connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle disconnections gracefully and maintain event delivery guarantees\n\n### Requirement 5: Database Integration and Data Management\n\n**User Story:** As a backend service, I want reliable database operations with type safety and migration support, so that data persistence is consistent, reliable, and maintainable over time.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use Prisma ORM for type-safe database access following SSOT principle\n2. WHEN data models are defined THEN the system SHALL implement repository pattern to abstract data access logic following Single Responsibility Principle\n3. WHEN database schema changes are needed THEN the system SHALL support automated migrations with rollback capabilities\n4. WHEN concurrent data access occurs THEN the system SHALL implement proper transaction management and optimistic locking\n5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and circuit breaker patterns for resilience\n\n### Requirement 6: Configuration and Environment Management\n\n**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want centralized configuration management with environment-specific settings, so that the application can be deployed across different environments securely and consistently.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables with validation\n2. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages about missing or invalid settings\n3. WHEN sensitive data is handled THEN the system SHALL implement secure configuration management with no hardcoded secrets\n4. WHEN different environments are deployed THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configuration overrides\n5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support runtime configuration updates where appropriate\n\n### Requirement 7: Logging and Observability\n\n**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive structured logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues, monitor performance, and maintain system health effectively.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN system events occur THEN the system SHALL log structured JSON messages using Pino for high-performance logging\n2. WHEN errors happen THEN the system SHALL log comprehensive error context including stack traces and request correlation IDs\n3. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log request/response data with configurable detail levels\n4. WHEN performance monitoring is needed THEN the system SHALL expose health check endpoints and metrics\n5. WHEN log analysis is required THEN the system SHALL implement consistent log formats suitable for aggregation and analysis\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each service, controller, and module has one reason to change and handles a single concern\n- **Open/Closed Principle**: Classes and modules are open for extension but closed for modification through dependency injection and strategy patterns\n- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Interface implementations are fully substitutable without breaking functionality\n- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Interfaces are specific to client needs, avoiding forced dependencies on unused methods\n- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions, through dependency injection\n- **Single Level of Abstraction Principle (SLAP)**: Each function operates at a single level of abstraction\n- **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**: Schema definitions, configuration, and types are defined once and shared across the application\n- **Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)**: Solutions prioritize simplicity and clarity over complexity\n\n### Performance\n\n- API response times must be < 200ms for 95th percentile requests\n- WebSocket message delivery latency must be < 100ms\n- Database connection pooling must support concurrent operations efficiently\n- Memory usage should remain stable under load with proper garbage collection\n- CPU usage should be optimized through efficient async/await patterns and minimal blocking operations\n\n### Security\n\n- All API endpoints must implement proper authentication and authorization\n- Input validation must prevent injection attacks and malformed data\n- Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit\n- Rate limiting must prevent abuse and DoS attacks\n- Security headers must be implemented for all HTTP responses\n- Error messages must not leak sensitive system information\n\n### Reliability\n\n- System must achieve 99.9% uptime with automatic failure recovery\n- Database operations must be transactional with proper rollback capabilities\n- Job queue processing must be resilient with automatic retry mechanisms\n- Error handling must prevent cascading failures through circuit breaker patterns\n- Graceful shutdown must complete pending operations before termination\n\n### Usability\n\n- API documentation must be automatically generated and kept current\n- Error messages must be clear, actionable, and developer-friendly\n- Development setup must be streamlined with comprehensive documentation\n- Type safety must prevent runtime errors through compile-time checking\n- Hot reload must be supported for efficient development workflows",
