The frontend will serve as the primary user interface for managing AI-powered tasks, providing real-time monitoring, interactive dashboards, and seamless integration with the backend API. This implementation follows SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion), SLAP (Single Level of Abstraction Principle), SSOT (Single Source of Truth), and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles while utilizing industry-standard libraries for optimal user experience and maintainability.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis frontend implementation directly supports the product vision by:\n- **AI-First Architecture**: Creating user interfaces optimized for Claude Code task management workflows with intuitive task creation, monitoring, and result viewing\n- **Real-time Transparency**: Implementing WebSocket client connections for instant task status updates and live progress monitoring without manual refresh\n- **Fail-Safe Operations**: Building resilient frontend error handling, offline capability, and graceful degradation when backend services are unavailable\n- **Developer Experience**: Providing type-safe components, excellent error states, and comprehensive accessibility support for all users\n- **Production Ready**: Ensuring performance optimization, security best practices, and scalable component architecture suitable for enterprise deployment\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Contract-Driven Frontend Architecture\n\n**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a type-safe frontend architecture with contract-driven API communication, so that I can build reliable user interfaces with compile-time guarantees and seamless backend integration.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the frontend application starts THEN it SHALL use Zod schemas as the single source of truth for all API communication following SSOT principle\n2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL validate request and response data using shared Zod schemas ensuring type safety\n3. WHEN data types are defined THEN the system SHALL generate TypeScript types from Zod schemas avoiding duplication\n4. WHEN components receive props THEN the system SHALL validate prop types using Zod schemas following Interface Segregation Principle\n5. WHEN form submissions occur THEN the system SHALL use Zod schemas for client-side validation before API calls\n\n### Requirement 2: Real-time Task Management Interface\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive task management interface with real-time updates, so that I can create, monitor, and manage Claude Code tasks efficiently with immediate feedback on task progress.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN users create tasks THEN the system SHALL provide a form interface with comprehensive validation and clear error feedback\n2. WHEN task status changes THEN the system SHALL update the interface immediately via WebSocket connections following Single Responsibility Principle\n3. WHEN tasks are listed THEN the system SHALL implement filtering, sorting, and pagination with persistent user preferences\n4. WHEN task details are viewed THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress, logs, and status with automatic scrolling and formatting\n5. WHEN task operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide optimistic updates with rollback capability on failures\n\n### Requirement 3: Responsive Dashboard and Monitoring\n\n**User Story:** As a system operator, I want a comprehensive dashboard with responsive design and real-time monitoring capabilities, so that I can track system health and task performance across all devices effectively.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL display real-time metrics including active tasks, system health, and performance indicators\n2. WHEN screen sizes change THEN the system SHALL adapt layout responsively maintaining usability on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices\n3. WHEN monitoring data updates THEN the system SHALL refresh charts and metrics without full page reloads using efficient React patterns\n4. WHEN users interact with charts THEN the system SHALL provide drill-down capabilities and detailed tooltips following KISS principle\n5. WHEN dashboard components load THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading and skeleton states for optimal perceived performance\n\n### Requirement 4: Authentication and Session Management\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication with persistent sessions and role-based interface adaptation, so that I can access the system securely with appropriate permissions and seamless user experience.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN users log in THEN the system SHALL authenticate using JWT tokens with secure storage and automatic refresh\n2. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the interface immediately reflecting user permissions and available features\n3. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL handle renewal gracefully or redirect to login with preserved navigation state\n4. WHEN users have different roles THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface showing only authorized features following Dependency Inversion Principle\n5. WHEN users log out THEN the system SHALL clear all sensitive data and redirect securely to the login page\n\n### Requirement 5: Offline Capability and Error Resilience\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work gracefully during network issues and backend downtime, so that I can continue viewing cached data and receive clear feedback about system status.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN network connections are lost THEN the system SHALL display offline indicators and maintain basic functionality with cached data\n2. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff and user feedback\n3. WHEN backend services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully showing cached content and offline capabilities\n4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with actionable recovery suggestions\n5. WHEN connectivity returns THEN the system SHALL synchronize pending operations and refresh stale data automatically\n\n### Requirement 6: Performance and Accessibility\n\n**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want a high-performance application that meets WCAG standards, so that I can use all features effectively regardless of my abilities or assistive technologies.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN pages load THEN the system SHALL achieve Core Web Vitals metrics with LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, and CLS < 0.1\n2. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading and code splitting for optimal bundle sizes\n3. WHEN users navigate THEN the system SHALL provide ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation support\n4. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL announce dynamic content changes and maintain logical focus management\n5. WHEN users interact with forms THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation feedback and error announcements\n\n### Requirement 7: Theming and Customization\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want customizable themes and interface preferences, so that I can adapt the application appearance to my preferences and working environment.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN users access theme settings THEN the system SHALL provide light/dark mode toggle with system preference detection\n2. WHEN themes change THEN the system SHALL apply styling consistently across all components using CSS variables and Tailwind CSS\n3. WHEN user preferences are set THEN the system SHALL persist settings locally and sync across browser sessions\n4. WHEN components are styled THEN the system SHALL use Shadcn/ui components ensuring consistent design language following Open/Closed Principle\n5. WHEN accessibility features are needed THEN the system SHALL support high contrast modes and reduced motion preferences\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each React component, hook, and utility has one reason to change and handles a single concern\n- **Open/Closed Principle**: Components are open for extension through composition and props but closed for modification\n- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Component variants and implementations are fully substitutable without breaking functionality\n- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Props interfaces are specific to component needs, avoiding forced dependencies on unused properties\n- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Components depend on abstractions (hooks, context) rather than concrete implementations\n- **Single Level of Abstraction Principle (SLAP)**: Each component and function operates at a single level of abstraction\n- **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**: Zod schemas define types, validation, and API contracts shared between frontend and backend\n- **Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)**: Component design prioritizes simplicity and clarity over complex patterns\n\n### Performance\n\n- Core Web Vitals must meet Google's standards: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1\n- Bundle size must be optimized through code splitting and tree shaking\n- Initial page load should be < 3 seconds on 3G networks\n- Runtime performance should maintain 60fps during interactions and animations\n- Memory usage should remain stable without leaks during long sessions\n- API response caching should minimize redundant network requests\n\n### Security\n\n- All authentication tokens must be stored securely using httpOnly cookies or secure storage\n- XSS protection must be implemented through proper input sanitization and CSP headers\n- CSRF protection must be implemented for all state-changing operations\n- Sensitive data must not be exposed in browser developer tools or logs\n- API endpoints must use HTTPS in production with proper certificate validation\n- Content Security Policy must be configured to prevent code injection attacks\n\n### Reliability\n\n- Application must handle network failures gracefully with retry mechanisms\n- WebSocket connections must implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff\n- Error boundaries must prevent component failures from crashing the entire application\n- State management must be resilient to corrupted or invalid data\n- Navigation must work correctly even when JavaScript fails (progressive enhancement)\n- Form submissions must be idempotent and handle duplicate submissions gracefully\n\n### Usability\n\n- Interface must be intuitive requiring minimal training for new users\n- Error messages must be clear, actionable, and provide suggested solutions\n- Loading states must provide clear feedback about ongoing operations\n- Keyboard navigation must be logical and efficient for power users\n- Screen reader compatibility must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards\n- Mobile interface must provide touch-friendly interactions and responsive design\n\n### Contract-Driven Development\n\n- All API communication must use shared Zod schemas ensuring type safety\n- Frontend types must be generated from Zod schemas avoiding manual TypeScript definitions\n- Form validation must use the same Zod schemas as backend validation\n- API client must validate responses automatically catching schema mismatches\n- Component prop validation must use Zod for runtime type checking in development\n- Error handling must use standardized error schemas shared with backend\n\n### TypeScript and Type Safety\n\n- Strict TypeScript configuration must be enforced with no implicit any types\n- All components must have proper TypeScript interfaces for props and state\n- Event handlers must be properly typed preventing runtime errors\n- Async operations must use proper Promise typing and error handling\n- API responses must be typed using generated types from Zod schemas\n- Global state must be properly typed using TypeScript discriminated unions",
