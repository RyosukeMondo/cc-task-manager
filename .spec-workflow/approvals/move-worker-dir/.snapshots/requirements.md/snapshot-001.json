The worker is currently located at `src/worker/` but should be moved to `apps/worker/` to follow the monorepo architecture pattern and ensure proper separation of concerns between applications.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis refactoring supports the product vision by:\n- **Production Ready**: Ensuring the codebase follows enterprise-grade organizational patterns for maintainability and scalability\n- **Developer Experience**: Providing a clear, consistent project structure that developers can navigate intuitively\n- **AI-First Architecture**: Maintaining the worker as a dedicated application that can be independently built, deployed, and scaled for Claude Code task processing\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want the worker implementation to be located in the correct directory structure (`apps/worker/`), so that the codebase follows the established monorepo architecture and is maintainable.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the project structure is examined THEN the worker SHALL be located at `apps/worker/`\n2. WHEN the worker is moved THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact\n3. WHEN the worker directory is moved THEN all import paths SHALL be updated to reflect the new location\n4. WHEN the move is complete THEN the old `src/worker/` directory SHALL be removed\n5. WHEN tests are run THEN all worker-related tests SHALL pass without modification\n\n### Requirement 2\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want the worker package to have its own package.json, so that it can be managed as an independent application with its own dependencies and build scripts.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the worker is moved THEN it SHALL have its own `package.json` file at `apps/worker/package.json`\n2. WHEN the worker package.json is created THEN it SHALL include all necessary dependencies for the worker functionality\n3. WHEN the worker package.json is created THEN it SHALL include appropriate build and development scripts\n4. WHEN the workspace is configured THEN the worker SHALL be included as a workspace package\n\n### Requirement 3\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want all worker source code to be organized under `apps/worker/src/`, so that the internal structure follows the established patterns.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the worker is moved THEN all TypeScript files SHALL be located under `apps/worker/src/`\n2. WHEN the worker structure is examined THEN it SHALL follow the pattern defined in structure.md with processors, claude-code, and monitoring directories\n3. WHEN the main entry point is created THEN it SHALL be located at `apps/worker/src/main.ts`\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The worker application should be completely isolated from the backend application\n- **Modular Design**: Worker components should remain loosely coupled and independently testable\n- **Dependency Management**: Worker should only depend on shared packages, not on backend-specific modules\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Communication between worker and backend should only occur through the job queue and database\n\n### Performance\n- Worker relocation must not impact task processing performance\n- Build times should not be significantly affected by the restructuring\n- Memory usage and startup time should remain unchanged\n\n### Security\n- No security implications expected from directory reorganization\n- Existing security patterns and access controls should be preserved\n\n### Reliability\n- Worker functionality must remain 100% intact after the move\n- All error handling and recovery mechanisms must continue to work\n- Job processing reliability should not be affected\n\n### Usability\n- Developer experience should be improved through clearer project organization\n- Build and deployment processes should be simplified through proper application separation\n- IDE navigation and IntelliSense should work correctly with the new structure",
