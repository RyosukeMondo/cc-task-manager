Currently, the wrapper implementations are dynamic and loosely defined, making it difficult to create robust, stable, and easily maintainable wrapper integrations. This project will establish formal specifications, JSON schemas, and behavioral contracts that define Claude Code's communication protocol, timing behaviors, and state management patterns.\n\nThe deliverable will be a complete specification system that enables future developers to implement Claude Code wrappers with confidence, predictable behavior, and strong type safety.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis specification project supports the core goals of creating maintainable, reliable automation tooling by:\n- Establishing clear contracts for Claude Code integration\n- Reducing implementation uncertainty and bugs\n- Enabling type-safe wrapper development\n- Documenting behavioral patterns for consistent implementation\n- Creating reusable schemas for validation and testing\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1\n\n**User Story:** As a wrapper developer, I want formal JSON schemas for all Claude Code communication protocols, so that I can implement type-safe wrappers with confidence\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a developer needs to implement command structures THEN the system SHALL provide JSON schemas for all command types (prompt, cancel, status, shutdown)\n2. WHEN a developer needs to parse response events THEN the system SHALL provide JSON schemas for all event types (ready, stream, run_started, run_completed, etc.)\n3. WHEN validating communication payloads THEN the system SHALL provide schemas that catch all structural and type errors\n4. WHEN implementing session management THEN the system SHALL provide schemas for session lifecycle events and state transitions\n\n### Requirement 2\n\n**User Story:** As a wrapper developer, I want comprehensive behavioral specifications, so that I can predict and handle all Claude Code wrapper states and transitions\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN implementing state management THEN the system SHALL document all possible wrapper states and valid transitions\n2. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL specify all error conditions, their triggers, and expected response patterns\n3. WHEN managing session lifecycle THEN the system SHALL define the complete session flow from initialization to shutdown\n4. WHEN implementing cancellation THEN the system SHALL specify cancellation behavior, timeouts, and cleanup procedures\n\n### Requirement 3\n\n**User Story:** As a wrapper developer, I want runtime behavior analysis and examples, so that I can understand actual vs theoretical wrapper behavior\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN studying wrapper behavior THEN the system SHALL provide captured runtime JSON logs with real interaction patterns\n2. WHEN implementing completion detection THEN the system SHALL document actual completion patterns observed in production\n3. WHEN handling edge cases THEN the system SHALL provide examples of error scenarios and recovery patterns\n4. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL provide timing analysis and bottleneck identification\n\n### Requirement 4\n\n**User Story:** As a wrapper developer, I want modular specification components, so that I can implement only the features my wrapper needs\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN implementing basic functionality THEN the system SHALL provide core protocol specifications independent of advanced features\n2. WHEN adding automation features THEN the system SHALL provide separate specifications for automation patterns and completion detection\n3. WHEN integrating debugging THEN the system SHALL provide optional debug protocol specifications\n4. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL provide extensibility patterns and guidelines\n\n### Requirement 5\n\n**User Story:** As a specification maintainer, I want automated validation and testing tools, so that specifications remain accurate as Claude Code evolves\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN Claude Code behavior changes THEN the system SHALL provide tools to validate specifications against runtime behavior\n2. WHEN updating specifications THEN the system SHALL provide regression testing to ensure backward compatibility\n3. WHEN releasing specifications THEN the system SHALL provide validation tools for wrapper implementations\n4. WHEN documenting changes THEN the system SHALL provide versioning and migration guides\n\n### Requirement 6\n\n**User Story:** As a researcher, I want automated web research capabilities for Claude Code updates, so that I can stay informed about SDK changes and behavior evolution\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN monitoring Claude Code ecosystem THEN the system SHALL search official Claude Code SDK documentation, GitHub repositories, and technical sites for updates\n2. WHEN behavior changes are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger specification validation against new patterns\n3. WHEN new SDK versions are released THEN the system SHALL research and document behavioral differences\n4. WHEN conducting periodic research THEN the system SHALL generate reports on Claude Code evolution and specification alignment\n\n### Requirement 7\n\n**User Story:** As a specification maintainer, I want change detection and continuous monitoring, so that specifications automatically adapt to Claude Code evolution\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN Claude Code behavior changes THEN the system SHALL detect deviations from current specifications automatically\n2. WHEN running periodic monitoring THEN the system SHALL compare current behavior against historical baselines\n3. WHEN changes are detected THEN the system SHALL generate change reports with impact analysis\n4. WHEN significant changes occur THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and recommend specification updates\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each specification file should cover one logical domain (protocol, state management, automation, etc.)\n- **Modular Design**: Schemas, behavioral specs, and examples should be independently usable\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize cross-references between specification components\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define precise contracts between specification layers and implementation guidance\n\n### Performance\n- Specification validation should complete within 100ms for typical wrapper payloads\n- Runtime behavior analysis should not impact Claude Code performance by more than 5%\n- Schema files should be optimized for fast parsing and memory efficiency\n- Web research operations should complete within 30 seconds for typical SDK documentation queries\n- Periodic monitoring should run efficiently in background without blocking primary operations\n\n### Security\n- All captured runtime data must be sanitized of potentially sensitive information\n- Schema validation must prevent injection attacks through malformed payloads\n- Specification examples must not contain real authentication tokens or private data\n\n### Reliability\n- Specifications must accurately reflect Claude Code behavior with 99.9% fidelity\n- Schema validation must have zero false negatives for valid Claude Code communications\n- Behavioral specifications must cover all documented Claude Code states and transitions\n- Web research must reliably detect Claude Code SDK updates and behavioral changes\n- Change detection system must have <1% false positive rate for behavioral changes\n- Periodic monitoring must operate continuously with 99.9% uptime\n\n### Usability\n- Specifications must be implementable by developers with JSON Schema and async programming experience\n- Documentation must include practical examples for all major use cases\n- Error messages from schema validation must be actionable and specific",
