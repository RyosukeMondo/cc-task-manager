Next.js built-in bundler with Turbopack for fast development and optimized production builds\n- **Backend Build**: tsx for development, tsc for production TypeScript compilation\n- **Package Management**: npm with lockfile for reproducible builds and dependency management\n- **Development Workflow**: Hot reload via Next.js dev server, nodemon for backend development, concurrent processes for full-stack development\n\n### Code Quality Tools\n- **Static Analysis**: ESLint with TypeScript rules, Prettier for consistent formatting, TypeScript strict mode for maximum type safety\n- **Formatting**: Prettier with Tailwind CSS plugin for consistent code style across team\n- **Testing Framework**: Jest for unit testing, Playwright for end-to-end testing, supertest for API testing\n- **Documentation**: TypeDoc for API documentation, OpenAPI auto-generation from Zod schemas\n\n### Version Control & Collaboration\n- **VCS**: Git with conventional commits for consistent history and automated changelog generation\n- **Branching Strategy**: GitHub Flow with feature branches, pull request reviews, and main branch protection\n- **Code Review Process**: Required peer review via GitHub pull requests with automated CI checks\n\n### Dashboard Development\n- **Live Reload**: Next.js hot module replacement with fast refresh for instant development feedback\n- **Port Management**: Configurable via environment variables with development defaults (3000 frontend, 3001 backend)\n- **Multi-Instance Support**: Docker Compose orchestration for running complete development stack locally\n\n## Deployment & Distribution\n- **Target Platforms**: Linux-based VPS servers, cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), Docker-compatible environments\n- **Distribution Method**: Docker containers with multi-stage builds, Docker Compose for orchestration, CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment\n- **Installation Requirements**: Docker and Docker Compose, minimum 2GB RAM, Node.js 18+ for direct installation\n- **Update Mechanism**: Blue-green deployment via Docker container updates with automatic rollback capabilities\n\n## Technical Requirements & Constraints\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- **API Response Time**: < 200ms for 95th percentile requests with database query optimization\n- **Real-time Updates**: < 100ms WebSocket message delivery for task status changes\n- **Memory Usage**: < 512MB per process under normal load with efficient garbage collection\n- **Task Processing**: Support for 50+ concurrent Claude Code tasks with resource isolation\n\n### Compatibility Requirements\n- **Platform Support**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+), macOS (development), Windows via WSL2\n- **Node.js Versions**: 18+ with ES2022 support and native WebAssembly compatibility\n- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with ES2020 and WebSocket support (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)\n- **Database Compatibility**: PostgreSQL 14+ with JSONB and advanced indexing features\n\n### Security & Compliance\n- **Authentication**: JWT-based stateless authentication with secure token handling and refresh mechanisms\n- **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation at API boundaries with SQL injection prevention via Prisma\n- **Process Isolation**: Secure child_process.spawn execution preventing command injection vulnerabilities\n- **Data Protection**: Environment variable secrets management, HTTPS enforcement, CORS configuration\n\n### Scalability & Reliability\n- **Expected Load**: 100+ concurrent users, 1000+ tasks per hour with horizontal scaling capability\n- **Availability Requirements**: 99.9% uptime with automatic failover and health monitoring\n- **Growth Projections**: Horizontal scaling via container orchestration, database read replicas for query scaling\n\n## Technical Decisions & Rationale\n\n### Decision Log\n\n1. **Next.js App Router over Pages Router**: Chosen for React Server Components support, improved performance through server-side rendering, and better developer experience with file-based routing. Alternative considered: Create React App with separate backend, rejected due to additional complexity and deployment overhead.\n\n2. **Prisma over Drizzle ORM**: Selected for superior developer experience, automatic schema migrations, and Prisma Studio debugging capabilities. Drizzle ORM considered for performance benefits but rejected due to steeper learning curve and fewer ecosystem integrations for rapid development.\n\n3. **BullMQ over native child_process**: Chosen for persistent job storage, automatic retry mechanisms, and distributed processing capabilities. Native approach considered but rejected due to lack of reliability features required for production systems.\n\n4. **Zod over class-validator**: Selected for schema-first approach creating single source of truth for types and validation, plus seamless OpenAPI integration. class-validator considered but rejected due to duplication between validation decorators and API documentation requirements.\n\n5. **TanStack Query + Zustand over Redux**: Chosen for clear separation between server and client state, reduced boilerplate, and excellent caching mechanisms. Redux Toolkit considered but rejected due to complexity overhead for project scope and team size.\n\n6. **Python SDK Wrapper over Direct CLI**: Selected for structured data exchange, better error handling, and leveraging full SDK capabilities. Direct CLI execution considered but rejected due to limited communication capabilities and parsing complexity.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n- **Single Database Instance**: Current architecture uses single PostgreSQL instance; planned migration to read replicas for improved query performance and fault tolerance\n- **Local File Storage**: Claude Code session logs stored locally; migration to cloud storage planned for better durability and multi-instance support\n- **Memory-based Connection Management**: WebSocket connections managed in application memory; Redis-backed connection store planned for multi-instance deployments\n- **Manual Scaling**: Current deployment requires manual container scaling; automatic scaling based on queue depth planned for future iterations",
