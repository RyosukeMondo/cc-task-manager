This feature establishes contracts as the single source of truth for system interfaces, enabling automatic documentation generation, type safety, consumer-driven testing, and seamless integration workflows.\n\nThe feature addresses the current challenges of manual API documentation maintenance, integration testing complexity, and the risk of breaking changes in the sophisticated worker orchestration system that manages Claude Code SDK interactions.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature directly supports the \"Developer Experience\" principle from product.md by providing type-safe, well-documented APIs with excellent error messages. It also aligns with the \"Production Ready\" principle by ensuring enterprise-grade reliability through contract verification and the \"AI-First Architecture\" by optimizing Claude Code integration patterns through validated contracts.\n\nThe feature contributes to the business objective of achieving 99.9% task completion rate by preventing integration failures and supports the success metric of maintaining excellent API response times through optimized contract validation.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1\n\n**User Story:** As a developer consuming the Task Manager API, I want auto-generated, always up-to-date OpenAPI documentation, so that I can reliably integrate with the system without manual documentation that becomes stale.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I access the API documentation endpoint THEN the system SHALL provide complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification auto-generated from Zod schemas\n2. WHEN a Zod schema is modified THEN the OpenAPI documentation SHALL automatically reflect the changes without manual intervention\n3. WHEN I view the documentation THEN it SHALL include request/response examples, error codes, and validation rules for all endpoints\n4. WHEN I use the Swagger UI THEN it SHALL allow interactive testing of all API endpoints with proper authentication\n\n### Requirement 2\n\n**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to define API contracts using Zod schemas that serve as both validation and documentation source, so that I maintain a single source of truth for API structure.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I create a new API endpoint THEN the system SHALL automatically validate requests against the corresponding Zod schema\n2. WHEN a request fails validation THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with field-level error details\n3. WHEN I define a Zod schema THEN it SHALL automatically generate TypeScript types for both frontend and backend consumption\n4. WHEN I update a schema THEN the build process SHALL fail if breaking changes are introduced without proper versioning\n\n### Requirement 3\n\n**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want automatically generated TypeScript types from API contracts, so that I have compile-time safety when calling backend services.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN backend schemas are updated THEN frontend TypeScript types SHALL automatically update during the build process\n2. WHEN I call an API endpoint THEN TypeScript SHALL provide autocomplete and type checking for request payloads\n3. WHEN API responses are received THEN they SHALL be automatically typed without manual type assertions\n4. WHEN schema validation fails THEN TypeScript SHALL provide type-safe access to validation error details\n\n### Requirement 4\n\n**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want consumer-driven contract testing for the Claude Code SDK integration, so that I can ensure compatibility during SDK upgrades and prevent integration failures.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I run contract tests THEN the system SHALL verify that worker service behavior matches expected Claude Code SDK contracts\n2. WHEN the Claude Code SDK is upgraded THEN contract tests SHALL detect breaking changes before deployment\n3. WHEN contract tests pass THEN I SHALL have confidence that existing worker functionality will continue working\n4. WHEN contract violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific contract failures\n\n### Requirement 5\n\n**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want contract validation in the CI/CD pipeline, so that contract compliance is automatically enforced before deployment.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN code is pushed to any branch THEN the CI pipeline SHALL validate all contracts against their schemas\n2. WHEN contract validation fails THEN the build SHALL fail with detailed error messages\n3. WHEN pull requests are created THEN contract compatibility checks SHALL run automatically\n4. WHEN contracts are modified THEN the system SHALL verify backward compatibility with existing consumers\n\n### Requirement 6\n\n**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want versioned contracts with compatibility guarantees, so that I can upgrade safely without unexpected breaking changes.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN API contracts are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility within the same major version\n2. WHEN breaking changes are introduced THEN they SHALL be released as a new major version with migration documentation\n3. WHEN I specify an API version THEN the system SHALL guarantee that contract structure for that version will not change\n4. WHEN multiple API versions are supported THEN the system SHALL clearly document deprecation timelines\n\n### Requirement 7\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time contract validation during development, so that I catch contract violations immediately rather than discovering them in testing.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I modify a contract schema THEN the development server SHALL immediately validate all affected endpoints\n2. WHEN contract violations exist THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages in the development console\n3. WHEN I make API calls during development THEN requests and responses SHALL be validated against contracts in real-time\n4. WHEN validation fails during development THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with suggested fixes\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Contract-First Design**: All API endpoints must be defined by Zod schemas before implementation\n- **Single Source of Truth**: Zod schemas serve as the authoritative definition for validation, types, and documentation\n- **Separation of Concerns**: Contract validation logic isolated from business logic\n- **Framework Integration**: Seamless integration with existing NestJS and Zod architecture\n\n### Performance\n- Contract validation SHALL add less than 5ms latency to API requests\n- OpenAPI documentation generation SHALL complete within 500ms during build\n- Schema compilation SHALL not impact development server startup time\n- Type generation SHALL complete within 2 seconds for incremental changes\n\n### Security\n- Contract validation SHALL prevent injection attacks through strict schema enforcement\n- API documentation SHALL not expose sensitive internal implementation details\n- Schema validation SHALL reject malformed requests before reaching business logic\n- Contract testing SHALL not expose production credentials or data\n\n### Reliability\n- Contract validation failures SHALL not crash the application\n- Schema compilation errors SHALL provide clear debugging information\n- Backward compatibility checks SHALL have 99.9% accuracy in detecting breaking changes\n- Contract test failures SHALL clearly indicate root cause and remediation steps\n\n### Usability\n- Generated TypeScript types SHALL provide meaningful property names and descriptions\n- Contract validation errors SHALL include field-level error messages with correction guidance\n- OpenAPI documentation SHALL be navigable and searchable\n- Contract testing results SHALL provide actionable failure reports",
