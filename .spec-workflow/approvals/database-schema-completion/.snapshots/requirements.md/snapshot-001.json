This feature establishes the complete data models, relationships, and migrations required to support intelligent task management, real-time monitoring, and result preservation. It serves as the foundational layer enabling all other features in the system.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature directly supports several key product objectives:\n- **Results Preservation**: Provides persistent storage for task metadata, execution logs, and results in PostgreSQL database\n- **Task Queue System**: Enables reliable task scheduling and execution state tracking through robust data models\n- **Multi-session Support**: Supports isolation and resource management through proper entity relationships\n- **System Reliability**: Achieves 99.9% task completion rate foundation through ACID compliance and data integrity\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1\n\n**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want complete database schema definitions, so that all application features have reliable data persistence with proper relationships and constraints.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the system SHALL create all required tables with proper foreign key relationships\n2. IF a task is created THEN the system SHALL enforce all data integrity constraints and validation rules\n3. WHEN multiple concurrent operations access the database THEN the system SHALL maintain ACID compliance and prevent data corruption\n\n### Requirement 2\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe database operations, so that I can build features confident in data structure consistency and compile-time validation.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN Prisma schema is updated THEN the system SHALL generate TypeScript types automatically\n2. IF database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide full type safety at compile time\n3. WHEN schema migrations are run THEN the system SHALL preserve existing data and maintain referential integrity\n\n### Requirement 3\n\n**User Story:** As a task manager user, I want my task execution history preserved, so that I can review past operations and analyze execution patterns.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a task executes THEN the system SHALL store complete execution metadata including status, logs, and results\n2. IF a task fails THEN the system SHALL preserve error information and stack traces for debugging\n3. WHEN users query task history THEN the system SHALL provide complete execution timeline with searchable attributes\n\n### Requirement 4\n\n**User Story:** As a system operator, I want queue state persistence, so that task processing can resume reliably after system restarts or failures.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the system restarts THEN all pending tasks SHALL be restored to their correct queue positions\n2. IF a worker process crashes THEN task state SHALL be recoverable from persistent storage\n3. WHEN queue operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain transactional consistency across all queue state changes\n\n### Requirement 5\n\n**User Story:** As a monitoring user, I want system metrics stored in the database, so that I can analyze performance trends and system health over time.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN system events occur THEN metrics SHALL be captured and stored with proper indexing for efficient queries\n2. IF performance analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated metrics with sub-second query response times\n3. WHEN historical data is accessed THEN the system SHALL support time-series queries with proper partitioning for performance\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each entity model represents a single business concept with clear boundaries\n- **Modular Design**: Schema definitions organized by domain (tasks, users, queue, monitoring) with clear separation\n- **Dependency Management**: Database layer isolated from business logic with repository pattern implementation\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Prisma client provides strongly-typed interfaces for all database operations\n\n### Performance\n- **Query Response Time**: Database queries SHALL complete within 50ms for 95th percentile operations\n- **Concurrent Connections**: Schema SHALL support 100+ concurrent database connections without performance degradation\n- **Index Strategy**: All frequently queried fields SHALL have appropriate indexes for sub-10ms lookup times\n- **Migration Speed**: Schema migrations SHALL complete within 30 seconds for existing production data\n\n### Security\n- **Access Control**: Database connections SHALL use secure authentication with least-privilege principles\n- **Data Validation**: All input data SHALL be validated at the schema level with proper constraints\n- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prisma ORM SHALL provide parameterized queries preventing injection attacks\n- **Sensitive Data**: User credentials and sensitive information SHALL be properly hashed and encrypted\n\n### Reliability\n- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints SHALL enforce referential integrity across all relationships\n- **Transaction Safety**: Multi-table operations SHALL use database transactions ensuring atomicity\n- **Backup Compatibility**: Schema design SHALL support automated backup and restore operations\n- **Migration Safety**: All schema changes SHALL be reversible and tested in staging environments\n\n### Usability\n- **Developer Experience**: Prisma Studio SHALL provide intuitive database browsing and debugging capabilities\n- **Type Safety**: Generated TypeScript types SHALL provide IntelliSense support and compile-time validation\n- **Query Builder**: Prisma client SHALL offer intuitive, type-safe query construction for complex operations\n- **Documentation**: Schema definitions SHALL include comprehensive comments explaining entity relationships and constraints",
