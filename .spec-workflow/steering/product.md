- Manage multiple concurrent AI-powered development workflows
- Ensure reliable task execution with automatic retry and recovery mechanisms
- Track task progress and maintain execution history

**User Needs & Pain Points**:
- Need visibility into long-running AI task execution status
- Require reliable task execution with automatic failure recovery
- Want to manage multiple Claude Code sessions concurrently
- Need persistent storage of task results and execution logs
- Require real-time updates on task progress without polling

## Key Features

1. **AI Task Management**: Create, execute, and monitor Claude Code tasks with full lifecycle management
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Live status updates via WebSocket connections showing task progress, logs, and state changes
3. **Automatic Recovery**: Robust error handling with automatic retries, process restart capabilities, and failure recovery mechanisms
4. **Task Queue System**: Background job processing with BullMQ for reliable task scheduling and execution
5. **Results Preservation**: Persistent storage of task metadata, execution logs, and results in PostgreSQL database
6. **Multi-session Support**: Manage multiple concurrent Claude Code sessions with isolation and resource management

## Business Objectives

- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce manual monitoring overhead by 80% through automated task management
- **System Reliability**: Achieve 99.9% task completion rate with automatic recovery mechanisms
- **User Experience**: Provide real-time visibility into AI task execution with sub-second update latency
- **Scalability**: Support concurrent execution of 50+ Claude Code tasks per instance
- **Integration Quality**: Seamless integration with Claude Code SDK maintaining full feature compatibility

## Success Metrics

- **Task Completion Rate**: 99.5% successful task completion including automatic retries
- **Response Time**: < 200ms API response times for 95th percentile requests
- **Real-time Update Latency**: < 100ms WebSocket update delivery time
- **System Uptime**: 99.9% availability with automatic recovery from failures
- **User Engagement**: Average session duration > 30 minutes indicating productive task management

## Product Principles
